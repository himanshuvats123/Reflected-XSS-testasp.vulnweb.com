# Reflected-XSS-testasp.vulnweb.com-
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a common web application vulnerability that occurs when user input is taken from an HTTP request and immediately reflected in the server’s response without proper validation or encoding. Attackers exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious URL that includes a JavaScript payload in a parameter.
